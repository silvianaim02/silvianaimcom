            My name is Silvia Naim, and Iâ€™m a Frontend developer. You can call
            me Naim. Iâ€™m very excited about learning and working in the IT
            industry, especially when it comes to making software.
          </p>

            Actually, I first have known into web development in 2020. But later
            on, I wanted to learn about other things in the IT world like IoT,
            Cloud Computing, and more while being a college. After a while, In
            2022 I realized that Iâ€™m better suited for Software Development,
            especially in the frontend. Because of my decision, I started
            seriously diving into frontend development and sometimes also tried
            on backend work.

            I created this website intentionally to write blogs and make it
            easier for me to document something useful. I hope that I can share
            experiences or anything that can be useful for other people
